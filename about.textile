h2. About Me ! (:


Hi Hello, my name is Michelle, but you can call me Queen Bee. I reside in Chicago, where my cats Minx and Midnight keep me warm. I speak Mandarin, Spanish, and English (obv). I'm the raddest girl you'll ever encounter, go to my tumblr or my snapchat to learn about me. Have a nice day and Happy New Year ! (firework emoji)
